## LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT
I learned that I need a JQuery file to use the functions. I was having issues using the $.get request and learned that it wouldnt function without any JQuery documentation. I also learned how to implement data into the chart with javascript and have it display on the chart. I also wanted to get more practice using DOM syntax so I wrote most of javascript code in that.
